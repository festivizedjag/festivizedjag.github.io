            i'm a 14 year old male individual. i was conceived and destined to be born on this universe on january 22, 2005. yes, 2005. <em>that means i'm supposed to be a freshman this year.</em> thankfully, i'm not. typically when you hang around me, all you'll see me talk about is smash brothers, music, or anything related to technology and the video games that i play.

       <h3>my personal life</h3>
        <p>
            i extensively listen to music on my own time. when i do homework after school, i like to be quick with my work, but i also want to show that i actually put effort into it. my favorite music genre is lofi hip-hop, preferrably songs with really good flow and really good lyrics. my favorite artist is khai dreams, and my favorite album from him is the "nice colors ep." check it out here:

            my own stuff. i like to make fantasy stories and stuff, especially stuff that is cryptic.

    <p> i make my own stories or lore sometimes if i'm bored. these lore bits often include segments of cryptic, foreign, and unknown entities. think of it like h.p. lovecraft but less descriptive and more of "butchered by a 14 year old". <br>
    a demonstration here:</p>
        <h5>PROBE STATUS: UNKNOWN. LOCATION: 
    UNKNOWN.TERMINAL STATUS: AWAKENED. INTEGRITY: UNKNOWN. </h5>
        <p>
            would you like to see the probes? they have been infected. gone for life. from this universe. we can still adapt and create terminals but to what avail? we always fail in our menial tasks. the devourer will take us all to his forsaken realm.
        </p>
        
        <h3>ANALYZING: PROBE 37-O8</h3>
        <p>
            probe recently delved into terminal 808. probe 37-O8 tasked with finding weapons to destroy the devourer. probe signals ceased at <em>03:27:96 P.M. NORTHEAST DIMENSIONAL STANDARD TIME</em> audio recorded was salvaged from terminal 808 after destruction.
