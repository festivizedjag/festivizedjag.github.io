         <h2>FIRST QUARTER FINALE: SCRATCH GAME</h2>
            <h3>GRADE RECIEVED: 3/B <br>
         FINISHED ON: OCTOBER THIRD, 2019 <br>
         PEOPLE INVOLVED: JHUN BACLAAN, VINCENT RUSSEL NINO</h3>
            <p>This project was a tough one. I teamed up with Vincent Nino for this
         <br> project. The project was due on September 27, 2019, and was turned in
                <br> late. We spent an entire day thinking of steps, <br> working on the document, and looking for websites. A prominent step that I could remember was the push code, which made use of colors to block off any progress <br> which involved getting the hex code of each color.</p>
         <p class="demonstration"> The embed below is the entire game. It isn't much, but we put a degree of effort in making this game work. </p>
